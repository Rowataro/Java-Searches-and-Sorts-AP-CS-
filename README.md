# Intent: 
*  Helpful guide for tested searches and sorts in the **AP Computer Science A** exam. 
*  Contains code for each algorithm. Visualizes each step. 
*  Note: **BlueJ** required to run. [Installation link](https://www.bluej.org/)
*  Note 2: Project only with **INTEGER** arrays. Feel free to work with different integer arrays in the test functions in the Main     class.

## Contains Java code for the following: 

* Searches
  * Binary
  * Linear

* Sorts
  * Selection
  * Insertion
  * Merge
  * Quick
  
### Helpful Khan Academy course, from which I derived inspiration

* **Note: The implementation of the algorithms are in JavaScript, though the learning curve is not too steep if one knows the basics of Java.**
