# Intent: 
* Helpful guide for tested searches and sorts from the **AP Computer Science A** exam. 
* Contains code for each algorithm. Visualizes each step. 
*  Note: ** *BlueJ* ** project format. [Installation link](https://www.bluej.org/)
*  Note 2: Works only with **INTEGER** arrays.

## Contains Java code for the following: 

* Searches
  * Binary
  * Linear

* Sorts
  * Selection
  * Insertion
  * Merge
  * Quick
  
### Helpful Khan Academy course, from which I derived inspiration
[Link](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms)
**Note: The implementation of the algorithms are in *JavaScript*, though the learning curve is not too steep if one knows the basics of Java.)**
